680
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:40,827
你们中间的一位会在今夜被淘汰
And one of you will be eliminated tonight.

681
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:47,500
肖恩 我们从你开始
Sean, we're gonna start with you.

682
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,044
给我们讲讲你的红毯金属造型
Tell us about your red carpet metallic look.

683
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,629
我决定表达一种更艺术的红毯秀
I decided to go for a more artistic red carpet.

684
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,632
也许是见面会
Maybe at the met.

685
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,216
这里使用了一种黄油伦敦的颜色
There was one of the butter london colors,

686
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,968
玫瑰金 像是珊瑚
Which was this rose goldy, like coral,

687
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,054
用作基础颜色
Which, kind of used as my base.

688
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,972
这种疯狂的流苏裙惊讶到我了
It surprised us with this kind of mad fringe skirt,

689
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,725
它正真衬托出了面料
Which really sets off the fabric.

690
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,519
我得到了整个十九世纪
I'm getting a whole 19th century,

691
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,104
有种 日蹦 风格的礼服
Sort of japonais-like thing.

692
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,981
-你说 日本？ - 是啊
-You said "Japonais"? -Yeah, I did.

693
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,941
-好吧 应该是 - 你在说什么？
-Well, it's like or-or... -Who are you?

694
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,526
我在说什么？ -日本人
who am I? -Japanese.

695
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,570
不是 Ais
No, but like, as in "Ais,"

696
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,322
因为你不能这么说 一个日本人
'cause you can't say, like, “a La japanese."

697
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,658
首先 我喜欢折纸效果
Well, first of all, I love the origami effect.

698
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,910
这很日本风
-It's very japonais. -

699
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,996
然后 如果它是中短裙就更好了
However, I would love this if it was mid-thigh.

700
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,208
我需要显现更多的腿
I need more leg.

701
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,126
对我来说 上面对比下面显得太沉重
For me, the top is too heavy for the bottom.

702
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,921
-现在 请你转一圈 那就很均衡了 
-Now, if you turn around, that's a beautiful balance. 

703
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:36,049
如此优雅 颜色又如此微妙
It's so elegant and the colors are just exquisite.

704
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,885
我喜欢你带来的这种帝国风
I love this empire line that you've given us,

705
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,054
抽象的裙子 并且它的颜色很特别
With this abstract peplum, and the color is very special.

706
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:44,933
从每个角度看都很有趣
It's interesting from every angle,

707
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,559
这对于红毯来说非常重要
Which is also very important for the red carpet.

708
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:49,729
-安雅 -我决定
-Anya. -I decided to go

709
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,523
走稍微有条理的方向
In a slightly more structured direction.

710
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,816
因为我想的是一种格莱美伸展台
Because I thought of a grammys runway.

711
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,318
那种让人感到紧张的情况
It's something that is a bit more edgy.

712
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,986
我想要做得不一样
I wanted to do something a lot different.

713
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,072
当你展示出来 给我的第一印象是
When you walked out, the first thing I thought was,

714
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,532
我不懂你的点
"I don't get it."

715
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,991
这是红毯秀 而不是伸展台
It's a red carpet look, not a runway.

716
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,494
叉腰 你觉得如何？
Hand on your hip, how does that look?

717
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,204
你明白我说的 我感觉 很疑惑
You know what I mean, I feel like, eh, it's confused.

718
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,498
因为把袖子做成这样是十分冒险的
'cause it's super risky to make sleeves like that,

719
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:11,793
因为很多人都会直接感觉 像是
'cause so many people are gonna instantly be, like,

720
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,628
我喜欢或者我讨厌它
I love it or I hate it.

721
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,547
我认为 你有些很好的地方
I think, whilst you had some really good things,

722
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,799
像是颜色和布料
Like the color and the fabric,

723
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,134
袖子有点让我失望
The sleeves kind of wreck it for me.

724
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,969
温蒂 你同意艾萨克的观点吗？
Wendy, do you agree with isaac?

725
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,887
-不 我不同意
-No, I don't. 

726
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,389
我喜欢这套衣服
I love that dress.

727
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,807
我觉得穿上很好看
I could pull that off.

728
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,392
40英寸的腿 还有长且抽象的袖子
40-Inch legs, those long, dramatic sleeves.

729
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,935
你在开玩笑吗？
Are you kidding me?

730
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,353
不 我必须得指出
no, and I do have to point out

731
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,646
从结构的角度来看
That from a construction standpoint,

732
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,481
我与我的设计同行们差得很远
I really am a wide sea away from my fellow designers.

733
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:37,652
我在最后时刻得到了很多帮助
I got a lot of help at the last minute today. 

734
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:40,864
并且还有很多需要修改的
And it has a lot to do with editing.

735
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,532
这件衣服需要从设计开始考虑
This dress has to start with the design.

736
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,492
你需要想象一个女人
You've got to think of a woman

737
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:45,827
从每一个角度被拍照
Being photographed from every angle,

738
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,704
我认为现在不适合
And I just don't think that's the moment

739
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,122
说那样的话
For a statement like that.

740
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,875
依琳娜 说说你的红毯时装的质感
Irina, tell us about the texture in your red carpet look.

741
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,627
她是要去奥斯卡或者金球奖的晚会
she's either going to the oscars or the golden globes

742
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,297
我十分幸运
And I was lucky enough

743
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,840
找到了这个 令人兴奋的亮片
To find this, sort of, interesting sequin

744
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,092
它的两种光影像是一种
Where it has, like, two shades in one.

745
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,553
我把它挂起来 有点雕刻的意思
But I draped it and I sort of sculpted it.

746
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:06,014
这种面料选得太好了
It's a really great fabric choice.

747
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,016
请为我们转一圈好吗？
Can you turn around, please, for us?

748
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,852
从后面看很漂亮 你知道  他们喜欢
It's beautiful from the back. You know, because they love

749
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,104
-过肩拍摄 -对
-Those over-the-shoulder shots. -Yeah.

750
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,856
真是太美了
this is so beautiful.

751
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,816
以及口袋和衬里 我说完了
And the pockets and the lining, I'm done.

752
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:20,069
它看起来有点重
it does look a little heavy,

753
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,447
但是 总体来说 很漂亮
But I think, overall, it's beautiful,

754
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,449
我特别喜欢 胸围线
And I love particularly, the bust line.

755
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,826
我喜欢这种直接剪裁
I love that straight cut.

756
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,162
它给人感觉上半部分毛绒绒的 这很雅致
It almost feels furry at the top, which is chic, you know.

757
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:32,081
像是 有点 迷彩皮毛亮片
It's like, a kind of, like, camouflage fur of sequins.

758
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:36,169
悬挂的亮片 礼服的颜色 我喜欢这种质感
The draping, the color of the dress, I love the texture.

759
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:40,006
看起来很仙女 我喜欢
It's just divine. I love it.

760
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,341
谢谢 莉莉
Thank you, lily.

761
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,926
姜果 -我用了这种红霞的颜色
django. -I used this blush color

762
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,470
并且有种下雨的质感
And there's this rain-like texture in it,

763
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,974
所以有种怀旧感 但同时也有现代感
So it has this really nostalgic but also this modern feel to me.

764
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:54,020
我感觉有点过了 当她站在这里的时候
It's actually grown on me, a bit, since it's been stood here.

765
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,898
我感觉当她走路的时候
I think when she was walking,

766
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,441
这种轮廓会让走路变得困难
I found the silhouette very difficult.

767
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,901
搭在背上的披肩
The cape part attached to the back

768
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,986
没有足够的气息来彰显她的轮廓
Didn't give enough breath to show her silhouette.

769
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,114
我喜欢这种背照
I love the back shot.

770
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,991
我不是剪开风格的粉丝
I'm not a fan of cutouts.

771
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,660
我希望能够全部放开
I wish that they would all go away.

772
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,537
当你走红毯时 没有哪里
When you walk the red carpet, uh, there's nowhere

773
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,456
会触碰你的皮肤 或是拉拽
That it grabs the skin, and pulls it in

774
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:16,084
或是给你提供维度
And gives you any dimension.

775
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,669
它看上去很重
It feels heavy.

776
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,295
我不知道那是什么 像是
I don't know what it is, like... 

777
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,505
也许接触身体太多
Maybe it has too much body.

778
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,006
内衬 内衬
lining, lining, lining. 

779
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,717
-比德儿 好久不见 -你好 阿莉莎
-Hi, biddell. It's been a few weeks. -Hi, alyssa.

780
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,886
我第一次呆在安全区
Well, I was here the first time and then I've been safe,

781
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,805
但我来不是为了表现得小心翼翼
And I didn't come here to play it safe.

782
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,515
所以我想制造一种光滑的质感
So I thought to create texture out of something smooth

783
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,016
这样会很有趣 我挑选了这些耳环
Would be interesting. Then I made the earrings

784
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,643
因为我们有更多的预算
Because we did have a bigger budget,

785
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,061
所以我可以这么做
So I was able to do that.

786
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,813
我感觉像是凯特布兰切特穿上这身礼服在走红毯
I can see cate blanchett on a red carpet in this dress.

787
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:40,316
我喜欢这种完全不同的形状
And I love how it is completely a different shape,

788
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:43,444
不论从哪个角度来看
From every angle.

789
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,071
如果你给我一副胸和一个深背 我一定要穿这件
If you give me side boob and a deep back, I am in.

790
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:48,658
我认为前面的线条很漂亮
I think the lines in the front are beautiful

791
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,619
并且这些耳环真的好看
And I adore the earrings. I really do.

792
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,205
我认为他们很搭
I just think that pulls it all together.

793
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,583
当这身礼服出来时 这里有些大小的问题
There's something about the size of it, that when it came out,

794
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,085
我所看到的是耳环一直在碰撞肩膀
All I could look at was the earrings, like, hitting here.

795
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:02,046
就想法而言 跟姜果礼服相差无几
It's not unlike django's dress, in terms of the idea

796
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:06,009
很窄的前身和飘逸的后背
Of a kind of small front with a very floaty back.

797
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:10,179
但是你做到了因为我们看到了更多的身体
And somehow you got it because we see more of her body.

798
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:13,683
对我来说 布料看起来很奢华
the fabric, for me, while it does look luxe,

799
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,393
这是不可原谅的
It is unforgiving.

800
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,146
-米歇尔 -当我想到金属和质感时
-Michelle. -When I think of metallic and texture,

801
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,189
我想到了60年代的绗缝长连衣裙
I think of the 1960s quilted maxi dress

802
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:23,318
我想把它变得更现在一些 更轻一些
And I wanted to take it in a more modern, less heavy way.

803
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:27,447
她像是很酷的女生
She's that cool girl going

804
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,990
去参加艺术馆开馆红毯
To an opening of a gallery red carpet.

805
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,034
并不一定是要去拿奖
Not necessarily going to an awards.

806
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,119
在红毯上 横条纹是非常难的
Horizontal stripes are super hard on a red carpet

807
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:36,497
因为它会把身体分割成很多部分
Because it's cutting the body off in so many places.

808
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:39,375
你的下摆？ 这可让我很疑惑
And that hem? That really confuses me. What...?

809
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:42,045
对 我想露出一点她的脚
Yeah, I wanted her little toes to poke out.

810
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,796
如果你想用直线条纹
If you're working with linear lines... 

811
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,840
又突然在下面截断
...To suddenly put a curve at the bottom,

812
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,134
看起来就像是失误
It looks like a mistake.

813
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,303
我愿意穿这身去音乐节
I would wear this and, uh, go to a music festival

814
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:53,681
享受我的时光
And have the time of my life.

815
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,725
如果有空调在下方
If there's air conditioning in the fabric...

816
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,477
完全地 你有足够的口袋装你的物品
Totally. You have pockets for all your good things.

817
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,604
用口袋装下所有的东西
Pockets for all my stuff.

818
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,272
我在里面寻找生活 我在寻找流行音乐
I'm looking for the life in it. I'm looking for the pop.

819
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,025
我知道有些质感像是这样
And I know that there's some texture and things like that,

820
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,653
但我感觉就是有些
But I just feel like it's just kind of got that...

821
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,197
你在刻意装饰这些像蛇一样的图案和蕾丝
your aim here is to try to make the snake and the lace

822
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:12,492
并且将黄绿色融入这种有机的条纹里
And the chartreuse into an organic kind of stripe.

823
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,954
它不是有机的感觉
