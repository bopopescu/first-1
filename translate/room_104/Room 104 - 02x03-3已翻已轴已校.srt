1
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:48,740
不好? 那好吧
No? Oh. Well, okay.

2
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,428
好 那么
Okay, then.

3
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,977
先生们 请你们出去
Eh, gentlemen, give us a minute.

4
00:19:00,388 --> 00:19:03,051
我以为你去了著名的"沃尔玛"
I thought you were going to this famous "Walmart."

5
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,640
它被高估了
Overrated.

6
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,925
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

7
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,400
我们还有沙拉
We have a salad course.

8
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,737
你想要沙拉吗?
Would you like a salad course?

9
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,422
我...不用了 
don't need a salad course. Um...

10
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,645
我受宠若惊
I'm very flattered.

11
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:27,154
你是一位不可思议的歌手 舞者..
You're an incredible singer, and dancer...

12
00:19:27,565 --> 00:19:29,177
以及说唱歌手
and rapper.

13
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,828
但你还是没回答我的问题
There's still an elephant in the room, though.

14
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,845
抱歉 我离开一下
Excuse me just a moment.

15
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,820
他的真名是什么?
What's his real name?

16
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,577
你还在纠结那个?
You're still on that?

17
00:19:49,611 --> 00:19:51,382
我不理解
I don't understand,

18
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:54,020
我们的邮件交流十分顺利
our emails were so promising.

19
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:55,380
我知道那种感觉
I know what it's like.

20
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,020
- 你确定?  - 当然
- You do? - Sure.

21
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,850
在酒店被一个有魅力的领导宠爱...
Being pampered by a charismatic leader in a hotel room...

22
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,790
甚至使他都觉得他爱上了你
where maybe even he thinks he's in love with you.

23
00:20:03,154 --> 00:20:05,220
另外 权利是醉人的
Plus, power is intoxicating.

24
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,234
- 伏特加也是  - 那不就是约会的目的嘛?
- So is vodka. - Isn't that what dates are for?

25
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:10,674
你睁一只眼闭一只眼 试图看到男人的优点
You squint at things and try to see the best in a guy.

26
00:20:11,337 --> 00:20:14,150
我喜欢相信别人
I like giving people the benefit of the doubt.

27
00:20:14,251 --> 00:20:15,314
我确实喜欢
I do.

28
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,510
等下 你现在是进入角色了吗?
Wait, are you in character right now?

29
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:20,140
时常 我总是不在状态
Often. I lose track.

30
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,182
你都没有在网上搜索他的信息?
You didn't even Google him?

31
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,010
我不认为我需要那么做
I didn't think I needed to.

32
00:20:25,074 --> 00:20:26,550
我们已经邮件来往了几个月了
We'd been emailing for months.

33
00:20:26,617 --> 00:20:28,500
- 我以为...  - 妹子 没那么难的
- I thought... - Girl, it's not that hard.

34
00:20:28,582 --> 00:20:30,010
尤其是在克里米亚事件之后
Especially after Crimea.

35
00:20:30,102 --> 00:20:31,691
我一开始进来时
When I walked in here,

36
00:20:32,422 --> 00:20:34,090
他是戴着结婚戒指的
he was wearing a wedding ring.

37
00:20:34,171 --> 00:20:35,620
但当我再次确认时 戒指不见了
But when I checked again, he wasn't.

38
00:20:35,691 --> 00:20:37,890
我发誓刚刚还在的
And then I swear he just was.

39
00:20:38,457 --> 00:20:42,370
他对如何表现自己有些犹豫
He can be a little bit indecisive about his self-presentation.

40
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,480
妹子 讲真 你在干啥?
Girl. Seriously, what are you doing?

41
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,354
我不知道
I don't know.

42
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,394
你知道吗 你是一个成年人
You know what, you're a grown woman.

43
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,428
自己弄明白
Figure it out.

44
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,194
纳森·伊万诺维奇
Alas, Nathan Ivanovich.

45
00:21:05,005 --> 00:21:07,074
我从不认识你
I never knew you.

46
00:21:10,697 --> 00:21:15,348
我不知道是什么 只知道什么应该
I don't know what is, only what seems to be.

47
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,560
或者不应该
Or not to be.

48
00:21:20,205 --> 00:21:23,130
我们到底是怎么支撑着这沉重的生活
How do we even hold up this heavy life,

49
00:21:23,405 --> 00:21:27,070
我已经减轻到
which I myself have had a hand in reducing

50
00:21:27,257 --> 00:21:29,942
只要基本的生存需求
down to bare survival

51
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,314
生存
Survival.

52
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,365
生存很难 但是也是有可能
Survival sucks, but it is possible

53
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,240
死亡更糟糕
death is worse.

54
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,340
我参与过的所有的事情中
Of all the things I have been party to,

55
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,730
我作为一个有能力...
I, who have the power

56
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,582
改变历史进程的人
to bend the course of history,

57
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,720
居然被区区一个女人...
have come up against a problem...

58
00:22:01,177 --> 00:22:03,120
给问倒了...
one small woman...

59
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,790
我该以什么身份面对她呢
and who to be to her.

60
00:22:10,525 --> 00:22:13,234
我应该对她真诚一点
I should be real to her.

61
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,445
除非我已被深深腐蚀
Unless I am corroded to my depth.

62
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,108
我已经超负荷了 我感觉到
I am out of scale. I feel myself so.

63
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,760
我应该再试试
I should give it a whirl.

64
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,845
你结婚了吗?
Are you married?

65
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,811
是 也不是
Well, yes and no.

66
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,280
我刚刚谷歌了你的信息
I just Googled you.

67
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,560
如果我没弄错的话
And if I'm not mistaken,

68
00:22:57,931 --> 00:22:59,622
你有妻子
you have a wife.

69
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,620
你能上网查到我?
You can Google me?

70
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,970
是的
Yeah. I can.

71
00:23:05,382 --> 00:23:06,740
并且很容易
It was pretty easy, too.

72
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,099
如果你没用那么多别名的话
It would've been easier if you didn't have

73
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,800
那将会更容易
so many pseudonyms.

75
00:23:13,074 --> 00:23:15,897
那么 你和你的妻子有什么约定吗?
So, do you and your wife have some sort of arrangement?

76
00:23:17,622 --> 00:23:19,750
有也没有
Eh, yes and no.

77
00:23:20,011 --> 00:23:21,657
你到底什么意思?
What's that supposed to mean?

78
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,940
我意思是 有一些吧
Well, I mean, sort of.

79
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,420
这种事没有模棱两可
There's no sort of.

80
00:23:25,497 --> 00:23:27,590
你要么结婚了要么是没有
Either you're married or you aren't,

81
00:23:27,645 --> 00:23:30,190
你和你的妻子要么有约定要么没有
or your wife and you have an arrangement or you don't.

82
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,600
不要沮丧
Don't get upset.

83
00:23:31,668 --> 00:23:33,005
我没有沮丧
I'm not upset.

84
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,520
我只是想知道
I just need to know.

85
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:42,350
我意思是 我不会随便跟人上床的
I mean, I'm not above casual sex,

86
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:45,840
但我想我们都清楚那不是我们在这的原因
but I think we both know that's not why we're here.

87
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:51,668
我真的很喜欢和你通信 喜欢和你聊天
I really liked writing to you and I like talking to you

88
00:23:52,445 --> 00:23:56,640
并且我们现在在酒店里 我真的想知道
and now we're in a hotel room and I need to know.

89
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,200
那你之前为什么不问我结婚没呢
Why didn't you ask me before about being married.

90
00:24:08,262 --> 00:24:10,100
因为你点了那个选项
Because you checked the box.

91
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,097
什么选项?
What box?

92
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,405
单身的选项
The one about being single.

93
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:15,542
错了
Oops.

94
00:24:20,617 --> 00:24:22,760
关于性的问题你也撒谎了是吗?
Did you lie about the sex questions, too?

95
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,839
没有 当然没有
No. No, no, no, no. Of course not.

96
00:24:26,194 --> 00:24:27,177
绝对没有
Never.

97
00:24:27,874 --> 00:24:30,102
这样会扰乱算法
It would mess up the algorithm.

98
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,450
如果你像对待工作 家庭或者其他事情那样 
What's the point of having a girlfriend or a mistress

99
00:24:35,497 --> 00:24:37,190
对我保密 那么做你的女友或情妇
or whatever it is you want me to be

100
00:24:37,245 --> 00:24:38,920
或是你希望我做的角色
if you're just gonna act the same way you do

101
00:24:39,005 --> 00:24:41,291
又有什么意义呢?
at home, or at work, or whatever?

102
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,120
我知道了
I know.

103
00:24:44,948 --> 00:24:47,965
这是我人生的悲哀
This is the tragedy of my life.

104
00:24:50,651 --> 00:24:52,525
你知道我人生有多悲哀吗?
Do you know the tragedy of my life?

105
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,000
不
No.

106
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,610
我知道 因为你重来没有问过我
I know. Because you never asked me.

107
00:24:58,685 --> 00:25:00,250
你在网上的时候真是很有魅力
You're really charming on the Internet,

108
00:25:00,297 --> 00:25:01,860
但是见到面你却不问过我的事
but then in person, you don't even ask me

109
00:25:01,908 --> 00:25:03,590
比如我悲哀的人生
shit like what's the tragedy of my life

110
00:25:03,645 --> 00:25:05,680
或是双亲是否健在
or even if my parents are alive.

111
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,120
我知道你父母还活着 你在邮件说过
I know your parents are alive because it came up

112
00:25:08,182 --> 00:25:11,257
你回威斯康辛州那次
in the email when you went back to Wisconsin.

113
00:25:12,205 --> 00:25:14,060
回去参加我父亲的葬礼
For my dad's funeral.

114
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,340
英语不是我的母语
This is not my first language.

115
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,950
你就不能试着说实话吗?
Don't you even wanna try being honest

116
00:25:24,011 --> 00:25:26,422
就一天 仅仅为了体验也不行?
just for like one day, like for an experiment?

117
00:25:31,234 --> 00:25:34,891
听着 我需要一些真实的人在我身边
Look, I need to be around someone real,

118
00:25:34,937 --> 00:25:37,490
达拉 我能从你身上感受到
and, Darla, I can feel that about you.

119
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:40,190
你是如此的真实
You are so freaking real.

120
00:25:40,354 --> 00:25:43,630
而我...所做的一切都是制造混乱...
And... all I do is create chaos...

121
00:25:43,702 --> 00:25:45,260
并且引人瞩目...
which is remarkably effective...

122
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:47,230
但是你是真实的
but you are actually, truly real.

123
00:25:47,302 --> 00:25:49,380
这就是我所需要的
And that-that is what I need.

124
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,230
这就是我在这里的原因
That is why I am here.

125
00:25:51,382 --> 00:25:53,830
抱歉... 我得走了
I'm sorry. I... I'm gonna go.

126
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,670
不 不 求你了 不要
No, no, no, no, no! Please, please.

127
00:25:55,725 --> 00:25:58,045
求你再呆一会吧
Please stay just for a little longer.

128
00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:59,790
再吃点甜点吧
Hey, stay for dessert.

129
00:25:59,862 --> 00:26:01,291
美味的白巧克力慕斯
A wonderful white chocolate mousse.

130
00:26:01,348 --> 00:26:02,740
我得走了
I need to go.

131
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:04,411
天呐
Oh, my God.

133
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,939
不 不
No, no, no,

134
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:10,380
他们说你这样离开不安全
they are saying that it is not safe for you

135
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,650
因为有...山火
to leave because there is a... wildfire.

136
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,860
我没看见哪里有山火
I don't see any wildfire.

139
00:26:21,725 --> 00:26:24,160
对了 他们说外面有枪击
Oh, yes. They are saying there is a shooting.

140
00:26:24,217 --> 00:26:25,460
你现在走不安全
It's not safe for you to go.

141
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,500
我什么都没听到 你听到了?
I didn't hear any shooting, did you?

142
00:26:27,577 --> 00:26:29,370
恐怖的枪击
Some threat of shooting

143
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,880
或是炸弹威胁之类的
or a bomb threat or something like that.

144
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,220
我不信
I don't believe you.

145
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,382
好吧
All right.

146
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,379
天呐!
Oh, my God!

147
