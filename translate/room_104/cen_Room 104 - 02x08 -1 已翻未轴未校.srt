3
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,330
谁? - 妈 是我
Hello? - Hey, Mom.

4
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,300
- 杰西? - 对
- Jess? - Yeah.

5
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,809
我很抱歉这么晚打电话过来
I'm sorry I'm calling so late.

6
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,180
没事
It's OK.

7
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,339
一切都好吗?
Is everything all right?

8
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,510
都好
Yeah.

9
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,349
我也很好 我只是
Yeah, I'm fine, I just, um...

10
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,179
我甚至不知道为什么要打给你
I don't even know why I called.

11
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,549
我想我只是过度工作 过度劳累
I think I'm just overworked and overtired.

12
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,189
也许是旅游造成的
Probably from all the travel.

13
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,420
我知道了 宝贝
I get it, sweetheart.

14
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,200
我从没跟你讲过这个
You know, I never told you this,

15
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,029
但是在你这个年纪的时候我有过严重的焦虑
but I had terrible anxiety when I was your age.

16
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,599
有时候很糟糕
Sometimes it was so bad, I mean,

17
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,069
我甚至不能起床面对新的一天
I couldn't even get out of bed and face the day.

18
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,809
我希望那些不要发生在你身上
I hope that's not happening to you.

19
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,210
你...你确定你还好吗?
Are you... are you sure you're OK?

20
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,449
我还好 只是...
Yeah, I'm fine, I just...

21
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,320
我一直做噩梦
I keep having this bad dream.

22
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,780
你想聊聊你的梦吗?
Would you like to talk about it?

23
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,040
杰西? 你还在吗?
Jess? Are you there?

24
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,999
在的 我在...
Yeah. Yeah. Um...

25
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,860
我那样说因为有时候噩梦就只是噩梦
I say that because sometimes nightmares are just nightmares.

26
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,530
但是有时候感觉如此真实
But sometimes they feel so real

27
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,109
到了白天也困扰着你
they spill over into the daytime.

28
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,010
你不想那样的
You don't want that.

29
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,579
你知道 如果你想要的话我可以过来看看你
You know, I can come over if you want.

30
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,579
妈 要开五小时的车
Mom, I'm like five hours away.

31
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,080
那又如何?
So?

32
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,419
所以我...我还好
So I'm... I'm fine.

33
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,220
我想我只是需要听到你安慰的声音
I think I just needed to hear a comforting voice.

34
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,229
- 我爱你  - 我也爱你 宝贝
- I love you. - I love you too, baby.

35
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,680
- 拜拜 妈妈 - 等下
- Bye, Mom. - Hey, wait.

36
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,600
怎么了?
What?

37
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,660
我刚刚感觉到...
I'm just getting this...

38
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,000
你电话那头的邪恶的能量 
bad energy from your side of the phone,

39
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,739
像是某种东西...
like there's something...

40
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,709
潜伏在你周围
lurking around you or something.

41
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,109
一些不好的东西
Something not quite right.

42
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,340
一些可能跟着你的东西 杰斯
Something that might be after you, Jess.

43
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,539
妈 如果你想要搞笑的话 这不是...
Mom, if you're trying to be funny, this is not...

44
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,249
我没有开玩笑
This is no joke!

45
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,720
你可能在真正的危险中 宝贝!
You could be in real danger, baby!

46
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,750
你需要离开那个地方!
You need to get yourself out of that place!

47
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,089
妈 冷静...
Mom, calm down...

48
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,580
从旅馆里出去 杰斯!
Just get out of that motel, Jess!

49
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,259
- 妈! 妈!  - 快出去
- Mom! Mom! - Get out of there!

50
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,799
- 立刻!  - 妈 我被困住了!
- Right now! - Mom, I'm stuck!

51
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,329
它们就在那儿 杰西 快跑!
They're right there, Jessie, run!

52
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,620
妈 我被困住了!
Mom, I'm stuck!

53
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,229
你怎么了? 快跑!
What is wrong with you? Run!

54
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,899
妈 救命! 妈!
Mom, help! Mom!

55
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,300
操
Fuck this.

56
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,660
我! 操!
Fuck! You!

57
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,450
打不开?
What?

58
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,060
操
Fuck.

59
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,170
不 不
No. No.

60
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,800
操
Fuck!

61
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,979
妈
Mom.

62
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,610
上帝啊 你把我吓死了
Jesus, you scared the shit out of me.

63
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,900
宝贝 你打给我 我很担心你
Sweetie, you called me and I was worried about you.

64
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,860
你还在那做什么 我叫你快出去
What are you still doing here? I told you to get out.

65
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,500
妈 这里没有门
Mom, there's no door.

66
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,399
- 当然有门啊 - 是的
- Of course there is. - Yeah, well,

67
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,699
我们出不去...锁上了
we can't get out. It... It's locked.

68
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,239
当然锁上了
Of course it is.

69
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,139
你为什么不用钥匙试试?
Why didn't you try the key?

70
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,369
钥匙?
The key?

71
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,170
杰西 你还好吗?
Yes. Jess, are you OK?

72
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,779
不
No.

73
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,879
不 等下
No, wait. The...

74
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,710
这是进屋的钥匙
The key is how you get in.

75
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,600
你出去不需要钥匙
You don't open a door from the inside with a key.

76
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,389
你在说啥呢 杰西? 我找到钥匙了
What are you talking about, Jess? I've got the key right here.

77
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,989
在桌子上
It was on the table.

78
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,030
快来 我们出去
Come on. Let's get out of this place.

79
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,999
看见了吗?
See?

80
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,769

杰西 我们走!
Jess, let's go!

82
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,840
杰西
Jess.

83
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,720
妈 小心!
Mom, look out!

84
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,300
不 拜托!
No, plea... Please!

86
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,319
这里是911 发生什么了?
911. What's your emergency?

87
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,419
你好 我...我在停车场的汽车旅馆
Hi. I'm... I'm at the motel off the parkway.

88
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,219
你能找人过来吗?
Can you please send someone?

89
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,259
发生什么了?
What's your emergency?

90
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,059
我想 这里有人...或者什么东西...在我的房间
I think that there's someone... or something... in my room

91
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,629
试图要伤害我
that's trying to harm me.
