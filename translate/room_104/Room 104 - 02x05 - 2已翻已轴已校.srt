1
00:11:08,182 --> 00:11:10,960
天呐 你说话的语气像我妈一样!
Oh, God, you sound just like my mother!

2
00:11:13,211 --> 00:11:15,142
我不知道 我...
Oh, I don't know, I...

3
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,010
我想大概因为
I guess I'd like to think

4
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:21,302
中学那年 男生女生忙着亲亲的时候
that when the girls and boys were kissing in middle school,

5
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,520
我沉迷于跳舞...
I was a dancer, and...

6
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,028
所以我错失良机
I guess I just missed that boat.

7
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,800
到了高中 他们开始上床的时候
And then by the time they were having sex in high school,

8
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:34,880
我才试着赶上节奏 献出我的初吻
I was trying to catch up and have that first kiss.

9
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,611
我想我是...
And... I guess I just...

10
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,365
从未赶上他们
never really caught up.

11
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,550
你真的是那么想的吗?
Is that what you really believe?

12
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,260
不
No.

13
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,510
不 我认为
No, I think that there is something

14
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,154
在我的内心深处
really wrong with me,

15
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,800
有些严重的问题...
deep down, that I don't...

16
00:12:00,057 --> 00:12:01,577
我不知道该怎么处理
that I don't work right.

17
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,220
可能你没有生病呢?
What if you're not sick?

18
00:12:08,148 --> 00:12:11,010
也许这种内心深处的感受
What if this deep-down feeling

19
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,240
导致了这一切?
is why all of this is happening to you?

20
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:20,120
导致了你...渐行渐远?
Why you're just... going away?

21
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,097
也许是的
Maybe.

22
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,380
你相信我吗 凯瑟琳?
Do you trust me, Catherine?

23
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,760
我相信
Yeah.

24
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,565
我想尝试做些事情
I want to try something.

25
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,411
你愿意和我一起吗?
Will you try something with me?

26
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,268
我们一起自慰吧
We're gonna masturbate together.

27
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:58,994
什么?
What?!

28
00:13:00,274 --> 00:13:01,920
天呐
Oh, my God.

29
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,819
我们一起手淫吧
We're gonna jerk off together.

30
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,080
- 不  - 来吧！
- No. - Yes!

31
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,220
我们可以 我们一起手淫
We are. We're gonna jerk off together.

32
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,640
- 不  - 来吧
- No, we're... - OK, come on,

33
00:13:10,685 --> 00:13:11,880
这对你有好处的
this is gonna be good for you.

34
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:13,140
不 我不能...
Oh, no, I'm not...

35
00:13:13,188 --> 00:13:14,925
我真的不擅长这个
I've never been good at this.

36
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,394
相信我吧 相信我
Just trust me. Just trust me.

37
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,590
墙里面没有男人...
There's no man in this wall...

38
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,140
我总是手淫
I do this all the time,

39
00:13:22,205 --> 00:13:23,165
- 并且...  - 好吧
- and it... - Great.

40
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,719
总是使我感觉舒服更好
It always makes me feel better.

41
00:13:24,777 --> 00:13:28,422
听着 我会让你擅长做这个的
OK, listen, I'm gonna make you good at this.

42
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,640
高潮很有趣的
Orgasms are fun.

43
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,920
它会释放你大脑中的胺多酚
They release endorphins in your brain,

44
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,720
胺多酚会让你开心 会治愈你
which make you happy, which heal you,

45
00:13:37,771 --> 00:13:39,970
让男人觉得你更有魅力...
which make you more attractive to men...

46
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,810
你明白我说的了吗?
Do you sort of see where I'm going with this?

47
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,400
明白 好吧 我会做的
Yes. OK, I'll do it.

48
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,560
好的 躺好了
OK, get comfortable.

49
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,640
我说话来引导你
I'm gonna talk you through it.

50
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,211
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

51
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,590
你躺在一片空地上
You're lying in an empty field.

52
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,500
全身赤裸
You're naked.

53
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,857
你感受到阳光...
You feel the sun...

54
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,979
温暖着你的肌肤...
it's warm on your skin...

55
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,590
它是来治愈你的
and it's there to heal you.

56
00:14:27,977 --> 00:14:31,622
并且有一阵凉爽的微风
And there's a light, cool breeze.

57
00:14:33,337 --> 00:14:36,920
它使你全身发痒...
It tickles you all over your body...

58
00:14:37,657 --> 00:14:41,880
像是一千个的...爱抚你的指尖
like a thousand... mmm... loving fingertips.

59
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,222
感觉好极了
It feels sooooo good.

60
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,670
深呼吸
Take a deep breath.

61
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,320
现在...
Now...

62
00:14:55,314 --> 00:14:58,380
让微风渗入你的身体
let the breeze penetrate you.

63
00:14:58,948 --> 00:15:02,470
风...完全掌控了你
The wind... it takes over completely now

64
00:15:03,062 --> 00:15:05,862
它让你感到一丝平静
and it fills you with a sense of calm.

65
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,811
它抱着你
It holds you.

66
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,050
这阵风就是你的爱人
The wind is your lover,

67
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,290
它亲吻你 拥抱你
kissing you, embracing you,

68
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,550
抚摸你的每一寸肌肤
touching every part of you.

69
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,880
但是现在
Oh, but now the wind,

70
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,428
它...它被什么东西卡住了
it's... it's getting caught on something.

71
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,434
你胸中的东西正堵着它
Something in your chest is blocking it.

72
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,839
太阳 开始消失了
The sun, it all starts to go away.

73
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,640
风想要通过 你也想要它通过
The wind wants to get through, you want it to get through,

74
00:15:34,697 --> 00:15:36,300
但它就是过不去
but it just won't.

75
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,540
云在天空聚集在一起
The clouds are forming now in the sky.

76
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,530
开始下雨了
It's raining. Yes.

77
00:15:40,617 --> 00:15:43,090
你必须得够到那里去释放它
You've gotta reach down there and free it.

78
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,250
不管它是什么 你必须要捅破
You've gotta clear whatever it is

79
00:15:45,314 --> 00:15:47,180
那层阻碍你的东西  这样才...
that is blocking that wind inside of you, so that...

80
00:15:47,234 --> 00:15:48,740
- 拜托 我在做  - 你没有!
- Please. I am. I am. - You are not!

81
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,320
- 我不行! - 凯瑟琳 你可以的!
- I can't! - Catherine, you can!

82
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,050
我不行! 它总是堵在这!
I can't! It's always been blocked!

83
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,920
不要这么想 你可以! 你绝对可以 凯瑟琳
Stop it. You can! You absolutely can, Catherine.

84
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,170
我相信你可以做到的 你可以!
I believe that you can do this, you can!

85
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,108
我...我可以!
I ca... I can!

86
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:05,670
- 我...我可以! 我正在做! - 放手去做吧! 捅破它 凯瑟琳!
- I ca... I can! I am! - Fucking do it! Get rid of it, Catherine!

87
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,340
- 用力捅破它 凯瑟琳! - 我...
- Fucking get rid of it, Catherine! - I ca... Ohh! Ohh!

88
00:16:10,114 --> 00:16:11,440
我可以!
I can!

89
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,220
我可以! 我可以!
I can! Ohh! I can!

90
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,050
你叫什么名字?
What's your name?

91
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,419
你还有什么需要的话再找我
Let me know if you need anything else.

92
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,262
好的
Yep.

93
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,240
你好?
Hello?

94
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,420
你还在吗?
Are you there?

95
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,828
你当然不在了
Of course you're not there.

96
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,350
因为你是我发疯时
Because you're a figment of my imagination

97
00:17:37,428 --> 00:17:39,050
幻想出来的
when I was going crazy.

98
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,350
这比墙里有个人合理多了
Which makes a lot more sense than a person in the wall,

99
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,170
你个该死的蠢货
you fucking idiot.

100
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,630
我在这 凯瑟琳
I'm here, Catherine.

101
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,622
你怎么样了?
What's new?

102
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,040
我怎么样了?
What's new?

103
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,017
你现在能看到我吗?
Can you see me right now?

104
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,285
- 我觉得可以 - 那么你应该能猜到了
- I believe so. - So you can probably guess.

105
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,130
我只是想打破沉默
I'm just trying to break the ice.

106
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,320
我明白了
Oh, I get it.

107
00:18:01,394 --> 00:18:04,000
你只是想聊聊天
You're just trying to break the ice.

108
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,580
好吧 你好吗?
Well, how are you?

109
00:18:05,657 --> 00:18:08,580
我患有严重的莱姆病
I have crippling Lyme disease.

110
00:18:08,674 --> 00:18:11,550
我正坐在这该死的轮椅上
I am sitting in a fucking wheelchair

111
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,700
因为我不能走路!
because I can't fucking walk!

112
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,885
- 我很抱歉  - 是吗?
- I'm sorry about that. - Oh, are you?
