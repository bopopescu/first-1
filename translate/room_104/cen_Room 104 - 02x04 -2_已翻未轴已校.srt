1
00:07:23,524 --> 00:07:26,558
我们之间所有的通信 所有的未知因素?
All this correspondence? All this not knowing?

2
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,103
你能来我很高兴
I'm just happy you came.

3
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:29,947
我也是
I'm happy you came.

4
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:32,202
我必须得承认 我担心了一阵
I have to admit, for a while I was starting to worry

5
00:07:32,227 --> 00:07:35,328
所有的一切最终会成了一个大... 笑话
that this was just gonna turn out to be a big... joke.

6
00:07:35,353 --> 00:07:37,125
- 我也是  - 真的吗?
- Me too. - Really?

7
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,361
是的 没错 我的意思是
Yeah. Sure. I mean,

8
00:07:38,386 --> 00:07:40,586
你和我 我们很能理解这件事情
you and I, we understand this,

9
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:44,012
但大多数其他人就不一定能够理解
but I don't think a lot of other people would.

10
00:07:49,773 --> 00:07:51,506
吉恩?
Gene?

11
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:52,964
怎么了?
Yeah?

12
00:07:54,124 --> 00:07:57,025
我感觉... 我准备好了
I think... I think I'm ready now.

13
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:00,978
好的 丹
OK, Dan. OK.

14
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:17,372
- 来吧 躺这  - 谢谢
- OK. Here, buddy. - Thanks.

15
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:21,465
- 好的 - 小心头
- OK. - Watch your head.

16
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,624
躺好了
There you go.

17
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:16,261
你准备好了吗 丹?
You ready, Dan?

18
00:09:17,677 --> 00:09:19,004
我准备好了
I'm ready.

19
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:21,004
好的
Ok.

21
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:30,802
- 你切下来了吗?  - 我搞定了
- Did you get it? - I got it.

22
00:09:35,065 --> 00:09:36,665
保持别动
You hold that.

23
00:09:42,196 --> 00:09:43,730
然后这样就好了
There we go.

24
00:09:44,363 --> 00:09:47,614
好了 完成
Nice. Nice.

27
00:10:14,463 --> 00:10:16,896
闻起来... 还不错
It smells... good.

28
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:19,997
我也觉得 我... 我没料想到闻起来还不错
I know, right? I wa... I wasn't expecting that.

29
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:21,403
你呢?
Were you?

30
00:10:21,643 --> 00:10:23,223
我也没想到
No.

31
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,997
它闻起来像...
It smells like...

32
00:10:25,022 --> 00:10:28,114
我之前从来... 没闻过的味道
nothing I've ever... ever smelled before.

33
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:29,559
- 对吗?  -  同意
- Right? - Yeah, agreed.

34
00:10:29,584 --> 00:10:31,851
- 很奇怪 - 闻起来真香
- It's weird. - It smells incredible.

35
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:34,653
是的 的确是
Yeah. It really, really does.

36
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:41,417
真香
Nice.

37
00:10:41,442 --> 00:10:44,075
你感觉怎么样了? 还在流血吗?
How you doin'? How's the bleeding?

38
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,200
暂时没问题
It's under control for now.

39
00:10:47,225 --> 00:10:48,371
太好了
OK, great.

40
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:50,184
到这边来
Let's just get you over here.

41
00:10:50,344 --> 00:10:52,144
谢谢
Thanks.

42
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:53,902
然后坐好了
There you go.

43
00:11:04,188 --> 00:11:05,420
好了
Ok.

44
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:17,592
谢谢
Thank you.

45
00:11:17,617 --> 00:11:19,247
不客气
Well, you're welcome.

46
00:11:19,272 --> 00:11:21,238
不 我意思是 谢谢你...
No, I mean, thank you...

47
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:24,398
为了我... 和我...
for doing for me... with me...

48
00:11:24,714 --> 00:11:27,090
一起做别人不能理解的事情
What nobody else seems to understand.

49
00:11:27,409 --> 00:11:29,676
我同时也要感谢你
Thank you for the same.

50
00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:34,027
我意思是 我很激动 下次就轮到我了
I mean, I'm excited for this. And for my turn next.

51
00:11:34,052 --> 00:11:36,752
顺便一提 也不怎么疼
It didn't hurt much at all, by the way.

52
00:11:39,235 --> 00:11:40,467
可以开动了吗?
Shall we?

53
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:41,948
在它变凉之前?
Before it gets cold?

54
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:51,293
警察! 开门!
This is the police! Open up!

55
00:11:51,318 --> 00:11:53,886
- 天啊 警察? - 什么?
- Jesus Christ. - What?

56
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:05,378
开门!
Open up!

57
00:12:05,403 --> 00:12:08,003
来了!  正从浴室出来!
Coming! I'm just getting out of the bathroom!

58
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:10,964
快过来 这边来 快点
OK, come on, come on, come on.

59
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:12,199
快点
Come on.

60
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:16,707
呆着别动
OK. Stay in here

61
00:12:16,732 --> 00:12:17,949
不论发生什么不要出来
and don't come out no matter what.

62
00:12:17,974 --> 00:12:20,793
好的
Ok.

63
00:12:26,091 --> 00:12:27,747
别 别 你不能出来
No, no, no, no, no.

65
00:12:30,303 --> 00:12:32,191
- 真好吃!  - 真的吗?
- It's so good! - Really?

66
00:12:32,216 --> 00:12:35,618
- 那是什么声音?  - 没什么! 马上出来!
- What's that? - Nothing! Just a sec!

67
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,817
你有毛病吗? 
What the hell is wrong with you?

68
00:12:47,086 --> 00:12:51,010
哇 太好吃了
Oh. So good.

69
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:52,712
你再不开门
If you don't open this door,

70
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:54,025
我就要破门而入了
I'm gonna be forced to break it down.

71
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,567
抱歉 来了!
Sorry. Coming!

72
00:12:57,405 --> 00:12:59,018
发生什么了 警官?
How can I help you, Officer?

73
00:12:59,043 --> 00:13:02,009
你为什么花了这么长时间开门?
Why did it take you so long to open this door?

74
00:13:02,034 --> 00:13:03,934
我说了 我在浴室
I told you. I was in the bathroom.

75
00:13:15,054 --> 00:13:16,587
你叫什么?
What's your name?

76
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:19,250
- 我名字?  - 对 你名字
- M-My name? - Yes, your name.

77
00:13:19,275 --> 00:13:20,807
-吉恩  - 姓什么?
- Gene. - Gene what?

78
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:22,695
吉恩・歌肯
Gene Gerkin!

79
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:26,148
丹・本德 今晚和你在一起吗?
Is there a Dan Bender here with you tonight?

80
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:29,782
我不认识你说的那人
Uh, I don't know anyone by that name.

81
00:13:30,562 --> 00:13:32,851
那这是给谁吃的?
Well, who's all this for?

82
00:13:32,876 --> 00:13:36,609
我和我的朋友
Um, for me. My friend.

84
00:13:40,532 --> 00:13:42,715
让我们来看看这个
Let's see here.

85
00:13:42,973 --> 00:13:45,274
吉尔・本德
Jill Bender.

86
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:49,249
她上周在她老公丹的电脑上
She found some unusual and cryptic emails

87
00:13:49,274 --> 00:13:51,593
发现了一些不正常的加密邮件
on her husband Dan's computer last week.

88
00:13:51,618 --> 00:13:55,179
她没有透露内容 但是很担心他
She did not divulge the content, but became concerned.

89
00:13:55,204 --> 00:13:56,958
所以一路跟踪到这里
She followed him here

90
00:13:56,983 --> 00:13:59,203
并看到他在十分钟之前
and watched him walk into this room

91
00:13:59,228 --> 00:14:01,039
走进了你的房间
ten minutes ago.

92
00:14:01,064 --> 00:14:02,640
她根据这些邮件里的内容
She called us to check it out,

93
00:14:02,665 --> 00:14:05,637
担心会危害到他的生命
as she had reason to fear his life,

94
00:14:05,662 --> 00:14:07,895
所以叫了我们过来检查
based on his emails.

95
00:14:09,264 --> 00:14:11,530
你现在想告诉我他在哪儿了吗?
You want to tell me where he's at?

96
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,952
我必须得问一句
You know, I have to ask,

97
00:14:14,977 --> 00:14:19,155
你难道不需要搜查证吗?
isn't this something you generally need a warrant for?

98
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,214
我建议你告诉我他在哪
I suggest you tell me where the gentleman is.

99
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:23,382
我明白你说的
I understand that,

100
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:26,703
但是我付了房费
it's just I paid for this hotel room

101
00:14:26,728 --> 00:14:29,390
并且我没有做错任何事情
and I'm not doing anything wrong here.

102
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:31,683
他在这吗?
Is he here?

103
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:37,582
他藏起来了?
Is he hiding?
